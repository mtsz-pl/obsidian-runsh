# Runsh

This is a simple plugin that allows to run shell commands from obsidian.
It is intended to mainly be used for launching dev environments for various projects all from one place, but can be used for any shell command.  
Made in Ukraine 🇺🇦

# Installation

Install from the community plugins in Obsidian.

# Usage

To add a command to a note, use the following syntax:

````sh
```runsh
code /path/to/project
%%%
Text on a button
```
````

# !!!WARNING!!!

The plugin does not provide any security measures, so be careful with what you run.
If you forgot the command you added to a note, you can quickly see it by hovering over the button.
